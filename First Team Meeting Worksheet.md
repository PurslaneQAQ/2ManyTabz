## Team Members Present

* John Albrinck
* Jackson Harris
* Katherine Taylor
* Yunjin Tong
* Jialing Wu
* Yaorui Zhang


## I. Identify a Common Vision
Streamline Google Chrome navigation! Make research easier and more directed!
*Youâ€™ve all voted on a common idea and themes. Now is the time to work through your commonalities and find a unifying vision between all of you. Answer the following for each of you.  This is the time to speak your mind.  Be honest with each other.*

### Commonalities
*Who makes up your team?  What are some common things you are interested in? Tell each other about the things you put down on the survey and expand on some of your passions.*

* We all are looking for having a collaborative and friendly group. 
* We want to have a good time while solving a problem we are all invested in. 
* Make some cool stuff! 
* Start earlier, give feedbacks, help with each other


### Inspiration
* Really beautiful UI that we've seen in demos, getting to see others' work
* How easy/impossible web dev seems sometimes. 
* Open-source databases
* stack overflow, people helping each other out... 
* Potential for actually useful tools! 


### Problems of Interest
We all run into the silly problem of having simply too many tabs open in a chrome window at a given time. We try to organize these by opening more windows.. then more.. maybe saving a bookmark or two here and there.. but we inevitably lose time struggling to navigate our research windows by icon and memory alone. Not to mention that, upon feeling too frustrated with the current state of our Chrome window, we all resort to just giving up and clicking that red x of doom at the top left corner. We wish there were a way to organize our research on-the-fly and without very much effort.


### Identify
* Easily updatable databases that will stay for eternity on the internets
* Interaction between front & backend
* Learning new frameworks!
* Big picture: how it all fits together


## II. Narrow In
*Now let's try narrowing in on a problem that interests all of you. Make sure to go around and listen to everybody on your team without interruption.*

### Problem Statement
*Chrome enables terrible organization!*
*Get lost when there are too many tabs*


### Rephrase
*How might we use Google Chrome to better organize our research? To never get lost!?*


### Reframe
*Reframe the question in at least 5 different ways to change the question fundamentally or imply a different solution set.  Try changing scope, or audience, or technology.*

1. How might we create an organizational framework to more efficiently use the internet?
2. How might we track user information about tab use for future reference?
3. How might we improve a user's organizational habits? 
4. How can we focus on the current target while using Chrome to help with the project?
5. How might we prevent getting lost within tabs on google chrome?
6. How might we track user usage? Are there certain connections that spring up? Could reporting this be useful to anyone?
7. Is there a way to free up space/memory/cache for improved performance?

### Choose
*How can we create a tool to help users prioritize important tabs and instill better research habits?*

#### Coolness
*What could be cool about this potential project?*
* Data/use analytics!
* Improving personal organizational habits. 


#### Challenges
*What could be challenging / unfun about this potential project?*
* Trying to distinguish ourselves in a meaningful way. Are there any original ideas left???

#### Success
*What does success look like for this project?*
* Making a web extension that we will actually use for the foreseeable future! That our friends will get excited about!


## III. Survey the State of the Art
*Do some research. Try to find what else is out there that is similar, either products, or technical papers that are related.*
* We may or may not have discovered a tool with the same phonetic name.. And various other tab organizers.


### Similar Goals
*Are there others working to achieve similar goals?*
* Yes. The more, the merrier!

### Differences
*How is your approach different/better than the state of the art?*
* It's 2020, we need some nicer UI and to harness that sweet user-generated data. 
* Even though the extensions all work towards similar goals, they are implemented in distinct ways!

### Inspiration
*Are there any existing products/techniques/research, that we could, by analogy, draw inspiration from?*
Yes - there are a few different versions of web extensions like this!
* Workona
* Mendeley -- research organization application

## IV. Team Dynamics
*And finally, let's think through a couple of team dynamics things as we'll be working together for the next month.*

### Schedule
* Still working on finding a time that works for everyone... but now we have a GroupMe!

*Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. That one meeting must include everyone on the team. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).*


* Zoom link - time of day.

### Responsiveness
*How often should team members be expected to check and respond on Slack?*

* Everyone should check the Slack channel at least twice per day. 
    * or enable notifications

### Group Decisions
*What types of decisions need to be discussed and approved by the entire group?*

* Any high-level changes from a previously agreed-upon plan.

### Individual Decisions
*What types of decisions can be made by a single person?*

* Implementation, troubleshooting, if nobody responds to your decision suggestion for an hour or two..

### Conflict Resolution
*There are three main types of conflict that tend to occur in group projects*

* *Creative differences: disagreement on any decisions related to the product*
* *Personal differences: friction between people due to manner or words said*
* *Ghosting: consistent missed deadlines or lack of contribution*

*Your group should decide on a plan of action to deal with each type of conflict. There can be multiple levels to each plan. Involving the TA's or instructor can be part of it. Try to be specific*

Creative Differences:
* Third-person mediator
* Introduce a third-party! Maybe Tim, a TA, or my mom (she never takes my side though)!

Personal Differences:
* Language/communication barriers: be supportive and give space for ideas to fully form without jumping in to finish the thought. Always ask for clarification! Don't try to rush things, ongoing communication!
* Third-party mediator again!
* Assume good intent! No gossiping!

Ghosting:
* Peer Feedback!
* Make sure people aren't taking on too much responsibility.
* Talk about the process.
* Assign concrete deliverables for the next meeting.
* If someone is still ghosting, then third-party..
