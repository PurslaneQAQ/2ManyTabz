## Background and Demographic Information
* _Fictional Name_: Nerdy Nimo
* _Demographics_: 
  *   Age: 20
  *   Gender: Male
  *   Location: Hanover
  *   Education: 20
  *   Job: Software Engineer
  *   Hobby: Reading tech blog
* _Overheard quote_: 
  I often open a dozen tech blogs while trying to solve a simple bug, rapidly firing from one link to another. I don't know if I'll need them later so I seldom close tabs. However, when I want to refer to a blog later, I can hardly find it since too many tabs are displayed on top of my browser at the same time (it's even hard to check the name of the tabs!)

## Narrative

*Short narrative or description about the user and why they're using your product/service (try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*

Nimo gets exhausted after clicking tabs one by one to find a desired page, so he desided to find a browser extension to solve his issue. He searched "tab manager extensions" on google, and choosed the one named "2ManyTabs" after careful comparison. This one is lightweight, but has all the features he needs: a clean display of tabs, and super efficient to find a desired tab!

He feels a great relief when looking at the tidy grouped tabs with the extension; he can easily find whatever he wants both from opened tabs and from history. It's not a pain anymore to find a tech blog that he has referred to, and his work becomes more efficient!

## Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations:__
    * Find an opened tech blog in a short time when need it again
    * Retrieve a blog from history 
  * __Tasks:__
    * Check the name of the tabs in the list of tabs (when there are too many tabs and he cannot check the names directly)
    * Find the desired tab and open it

  * __Pain Points, Concerns, and Challenges:__
    * When there are too many tabs, he needs to delete some of them (and it's hard to decide which one is needed)
    * It's not easy to find the blogs that he has actually used out of those many tabs
  * _User Flow_
    * Open different tabs
    * Group them by themes/ topic
    * When need to open a blog, click the group (and filter by tag if needed) to find the tab
    * save the group when closing the browser and reopen the tabs in the folder by a simple click next time!

* _Demographics_: 
  *   Age: 23
  *   Gender: Female
  *   Location: Boston
  *   Education: PhD Student
  *   Job: PhD Student

* _Overheard quote_: 
  I just wish there were a way for chrome to divide itself up into more pages so I don't have to spend so much time clicking through tabs trying to find what I need.

## Narrative

*Short narrative or description about the user and why they're using your product/service (try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*

Lily is a researcher working at the forefront of Machine Learning research in Boston. As such, she spends most of her day navigating the internet trying to compile her research in a meaningful way. This often leads to internet wormholes, in which there is way too much beautiful and important information to just click one tab, or just read one paper. Plus, she has a slight obsession with looking at cute animals on reddit and takes the occasional study break to play chess online with her friends. These sites are particularly distracting when they stay open in her browser. 

This all changed when a friend suggested she check out 2ManyTabs. Now, Lily keeps all of her research well-organized; her internet usage is so efficient!


## Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations:__
    * Keep track of her research
    * Wants to have a work/life balance on the internet
  * __Tasks:__
    * Navigate efficiently between work and life
  * __Pain Points, Concerns, and Challenges:__
    * When there are too many tabs, she loses track of where she is
    * She gets distracted by Reddit but it hurts to close tabs altogether
  * _User Flow_
    * Create organizational hierarchies based on research/homework
    * Group them by themes/ topic

## Background and Demographic Information
  * _Fictional Name_: Susanna Bin
  * _Demographics_: 
      *   Age: 28
      *   gender: Female
      *   Location: Cambridge
      *   Education: Philosophy
      *   Job: Counselor
      *   Hobby: shopping
  * _Overheard quote_: "I wish my *whole* life were more tidy and organized."

## Narrative

*I love the internet and all the convenience it brings to me. There are plenty of new things to explore and learn every day. But the more I explore, the more tabs are created and finally I  get lost with where I am and which direction I need to focus on. What's more, I wish I could make chrome more navigable. For example, when I am doing my homework, I wish all tabs were related to my assignments and other stuff were seperated. However, a youtube tab is near my study tab, and I would be easily distracted by a great video and lose valuable time.*

## Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations:__
    * Only important, task-related tabs are currently displayed on the browser*
    * Help the user focus on a single task and easily find the most important content.*
  * __Tasks:__
    * By using our extension, the user can easily handle their browser tabs and make those tabs organized as well as concise.
  * __Pain Points, Concerns, and Challenges:__
    * Susanna is concerned with the unrelated tabs that might distract her from the current work (like wasting time on youtube videos while having homework to do).
  * _User Flow_
    * By using our chrome extension, she can focus on her homework and easily remove hide unrelated tabs for later exploration.

# Tabatha Taggerton

![sketch/picture](https://satirev.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Grandma-Finds-The-Internet.jpg?itok=ilQ_e_ws)

## Background and Demographic Information
  * _Fictional Name_: Tabatha Taggerton
  * _Demographics_: 87 years old, 23 grandkids
  * _Overheard quote_: "Jeffrey, come help your grandma find the Google!"

## Narrative

Tabatha Taggerton has lived a long, happy and successful life and is currently enjoying retirement in sunny Florida. Unfortunately, she has never had much luck figuring out technology and her tech-savvy grandchildren, who live on the west coast, aren't much help over the phone. Tabatha mainly uses her computer for e-mail, but sometimes ventures onto the Internet to look something up. When she does make it to the Internet, Tabatha doesn't really know what's going on. She clicks all over the place to try and find what she's looking for (does she even know?) and often accidentally opens pop-up after pop-up. To make matters worse, she doesn't even know what a tab is and certainly would never think to close one. Tabatha currently has 149 tabs open.  

## Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations:__
    * Filter out as many unused and spam/pop-up tabs as possible to keep the browser clear over long periods of time
    * Keep tabs as intuitive as possible, so even someone like Tabatha can figure out the Internet. 
  * __Tasks:__
    * By using our extension, tabs that Tabatha accidentally opened months ago will close automatically, keeping her browser clear enough for Tabatha's very basic use cases. 
  * __Pain Points, Concerns, and Challenges:__
    * With over a hundred open tabs, Tabatha's browser is incredibly slow
    * While Tabatha usually (eventually) stumbles upon Google at the top of the screen, the tab text is now too small for her to read, rendering the Internet entirely useless.
  * _User Flow_
    * During one family visit to Florida, Tabatha's grandson Nerdy Nimo sees how many tabs are currently open on her computer and installs his favorite Google Chrome tab manager extension, 2ManyTabz. Of course, Tabatha doesn't know what a Google Chrome extension is and and the program runs untouched for years.
